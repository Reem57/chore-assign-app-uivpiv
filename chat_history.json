You want to create a chore management app for your household. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Chore Creation/Management:** A screen where you can add chores, specify the amount of times per week they need to be done, and edit/delete existing chores.\n*   **User Management:** A way to add the names of people in your household to the app.\n*   **Automated Assignment:** Implement the logic to automatically assign chores to household members. Initially, this could be a simple round-robin assignment.\n*   **Home Screen:** A dashboard showing the assigned chores for each person.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#2E294E` (Dark Indigo)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#6E7191` (Cool Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#645CAA` (Amethyst)\n    *   Secondary: `#A084DC` (Lavender)\n    *   Accent: `#D0B8A8` (Taupe)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#EBC7E8` (Light Lilac)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\".\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create UI for Chore Management:** Create a new screen or component for adding, editing, and deleting chores. This will involve input fields for the chore name, frequency, and potentially other details.\n2.  **Create UI for User Management:** Create a screen or component where you can add and manage the list of people in your household.\n3.  **Implement Chore Assignment Logic:** Write the code that takes the list of chores and the list of people and assigns chores to each person. Start with a simple round-robin approach.\n4.  **Create Home Screen:** Design the main dashboard that displays the assigned chores for each person.\n5.  **Navigation:** Ensure smooth navigation between all screens.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\nAfter the coding agent is done with the implementation, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-16T22:14:49.868290"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a chore management app for your household!
