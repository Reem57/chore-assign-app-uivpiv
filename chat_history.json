You want to create a chore management app for your household. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Chore Creation/Management:** A screen where you can add chores, specify the amount of times per week they need to be done, and edit/delete existing chores.\n*   **User Management:** A way to add the names of people in your household to the app.\n*   **Automated Assignment:** Implement the logic to automatically assign chores to household members. Initially, this could be a simple round-robin assignment.\n*   **Home Screen:** A dashboard showing the assigned chores for each person.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#2E294E` (Dark Indigo)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#6E7191` (Cool Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#645CAA` (Amethyst)\n    *   Secondary: `#A084DC` (Lavender)\n    *   Accent: `#D0B8A8` (Taupe)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#EBC7E8` (Light Lilac)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\".\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create UI for Chore Management:** Create a new screen or component for adding, editing, and deleting chores. This will involve input fields for the chore name, frequency, and potentially other details.\n2.  **Create UI for User Management:** Create a screen or component where you can add and manage the list of people in your household.\n3.  **Implement Chore Assignment Logic:** Write the code that takes the list of chores and the list of people and assigns chores to each person. Start with a simple round-robin approach.\n4.  **Create Home Screen:** Design the main dashboard that displays the assigned chores for each person.\n5.  **Navigation:** Ensure smooth navigation between all screens.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\nAfter the coding agent is done with the implementation, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-16T22:14:49.868290"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a chore management app for your household!

You, as the admin, will have special credentials that grant you access to the chore and people management features. Other users will have limited access.\n3.  **Restricting Access:** I will modify the `ChoresScreen` and `PeopleScreen` components to check if the logged-in user has admin privileges.
